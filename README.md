# MIPS-Pocesssor-NON-PIPELINED
Course Project for the course 2018EG201 by prof.Nandita Rao
MIPS PROCESSOR NON PIPELINED

FEATURES:
assembly to binary instruction convertor - 3.py
variable data and instruction memory
runs lw,sw,add,sub,and,or,beq etc - not all are supported in converter



How to convert instructions in 3.py?
    Run the python code
    Write the instructions you want.
    Add "End" at the end to mark end of input.
    The bin instructions will be in file "instruction".

How to vary data and instruction?
    Put the binary data in data.mem
    data memory is 8 bit wide    
    Put the binary instruction in testinstr.mem
    instruction memory is 32 bit wide
    For coding instructions assume location 1 in editor correspond to mem location 0
    Please change the size of data memory and instruction memory to accomodate the full input.
    They will be in datamemory.v and instructionmemory.v
